            Tarot is a super fun, spiritual, and meaningful activity that can
            help you gain more insight into your every day life. You don‚Äôt need
            to have ‚Äúthe gift‚Äù to read tarot. All you need is a tarot deck and
            an open mind üòä

        <p>
          <b>Step 1:</b>
          Acquire a tarot deck. Many stores, online and IRL, sell them. Maybe
          someone gifted you a set. Use them ‚ù§Ô∏è
        </p>

      <div class="box two">
        <img
          src="step2.jpg"
          class="short-pic"
          alt="pouch with tarot cards underneath a throw pillow on a couch"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 2:</b>
          Build a bond with your deck. Put it underneath your pillow before
          going to sleep.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box three">
        <img
          src="step3.JPG"
          class="short-pic"
          alt="top view perspective of a deck of tarot cards with patterned back side"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 3:</b>
          Choose a safe and calm space to read your cards. You will need a flat
          surface. Bonus points if you have a nice tablecloth (I do not).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box four">
        <img
          src="step4.JPG"
          class="short-pic"
          alt="three tarot cards laid out in a row, right side up, upside down, and right side up again"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 4:</b>
          Do you want to include upside-down cards as options? Your cards‚Äô
          orientation is completely up to you and both versions are valid! If
          you‚Äôre a beginner and want to learn the cards first, I would recommend
          keeping all the cards up right.

      <div class="box five">
        <img

          alt="a hand holding shuffled tarot cards"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 5:</b>
          Shuffle your cards with a question in mind. Try to avoid yes/no
          questions. The energy you pour into your cards will be a major
          influence.

      <div class="box six">

          alt="tarot cards spread out in a row with the back sides facing up"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 6:</b>
          Fan the cards out in a row, face down.

      <div class="box seven">
        <img

          alt="a hand pulling out a tarot card from a horizontal spread"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 7:</b>
          With your left hand, pull a card down while still keeping it face
          down.

      <div class="box eight">
        <img

          alt="a tarot card depicting a man sitting on a chariot guarded by sphinxes"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Step 8:</b>
          With your left hand, flip the card over. Take a moment to observe the
          imagery. What are your first impressions? What do the colors mean to
          you? What feelings does the imagery evoke?

        <p>
          <b>Step 9:</b>
          Refer to a guide to get a complete understanding of what the card
          means. I recommend Liz Dean‚Äôs
